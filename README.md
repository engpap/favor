# Design and Implementation of Mobile App Project

## Project Overview
The project consists of the development of a cross-platform Flutter mobile application named "Favor". The application's backend is built using node.js and express.js, with data management facilitated by a cloud-hosted MongoDB database. To enrich the app's capabilities, we've integrated several essential APIs:
- **Google Auth**: For user sign-in and signup.
- **Google Calendar**: Enabling users to schedule favors and events within their calendar.
- **Google Maps**: Enhancing user experience by providing clear favor delivery locations.
- **Slightengine**: Implementing advanced content filtering to maintain a respectful community environment by rejecting inappropriate posts.

## The Essence of "Favor"
At its core, Favor serves as a conduit between individuals requiring assistance and those willing to provide help. The app's simplicity redefines the process of favor exchanges, making it intuitive and user-friendly.

## Requirements
To ensure the application runs, developers must have access to specific untracked files on GitHub, containing sensitive data such as Google IDs. These files include:
* `client/ios/Runner/Info.plist`
* `client/android/app/build.gradle`
